# Blockchain

This algorithm uses a LinkedList data structure to implement a Blockchain. Each chain contains a reference to the next chain, a hash value representing the data that is passed in and the data as a string. `calc_hash()` and `insert()` methods have a time complexity of O(1) and printing the list has O(n) because iwe have to go through the entire linked list.
